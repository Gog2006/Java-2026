# Java-2026

Java coursework and practical assignments completed at Université Côte d'Azur in 2026.

## Educational Purpose

This repository contains academic projects created for learning Java programming fundamentals. The code is shared publicly for educational benefit and portfolio demonstration.

## Practical Sessions (TD)

### TD1 - Object-Oriented Programming Basics
- **Point Class**: Implementation of 2D point with distance calculations
- **Basic OOP**: Constructors, methods, and user interaction
- **Topics**: Classes, objects, encapsulation, basic I/O

### TD2 - Data Structures 
- **EnsembleEntierBorne**: Bounded integer set implementation
- **Boolean Arrays**: Set operations using boolean arrays
- **Topics**: Arrays, boolean logic, set operations

### Future TDs
More practical sessions will be added following the same structure:
- Each TD in its own directory
- Source code in `src/` subdirectory
- Compiled classes in `bin/` (excluded from git)
- Package-based organization

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code)

### Running the Code

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gog2006/Java-2026.git
   cd Java-2026
   ```

2. **Navigate to a TD directory:**
   ```bash
   cd TD1  # or TD2, etc.
   ```

3. **Compile and run:**
   ```bash
   # Compile all Java files
   javac -d bin src/**/*.java
   
   # Run a specific main class
   java -cp bin point.Main
   ```

### IDE Setup
- Import each TD as a separate Java project
- Source folder: `src/`
- Output folder: `bin/`

## Learning Objectives

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, collections, custom implementations
- **Java Fundamentals**: Syntax, types, control structures
- **Software Design**: Package organization, method design
- **Testing**: Unit testing and validation

## TD Template Structure

Each TD follows this consistent structure:
```
TDX/
├── src/
│   └── packagename/
│       ├── MainClass.java
│       └── HelperClass.java
└── bin/ (generated, not in git)
```
